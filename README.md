# postmatch
Research into address matching using a combination of machine-learning, edit distance and open-source software.

This research was conducted during my PhD at Charles Sturt University and presented at the AusDM2021 conference. It combines the open-source LibPostal library with post-processing to improve the Libpostal parsing and combines it with an XGBoost machine-learning model to improve the matching of addresses from two separate lists.
This software will get worked on from time to time and be updated as I go. The software was developed in R using the libraries mentioned in the .R source code.
